Hi madgey <3
I have finished the bulk of everything so all we need to do now is polish!

- I have connected the logout, profile and home buttons -
but havent done login/signin but that should be easy - wym pookie <3

- Make sure the font is consistent throughout, im using #151f1b
and Fuller Sans font - BOSH

- I still might try to have a go at the navigation bar but its not a priority just yet - wym

- The like, comment etc icons need debuggling to they sit side by side

- The calander and my community leader needs adjusting so its aligned properly,
again not the biggest priority

- For some reason the sidebar is not sticking but it's a small detail

- Going to adjust the text colouring on the navigation also 

- Then we can always add to the slides

- (big) if i have time, i can work on some more pages but i probably cba

- All just little things so we're in a good place i think :)
